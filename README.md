## 📊 Training Metrics

### 📉 Loss Curve

![Loss Curve](results/loss_curve.png)

### 📈 Accuracy Curve

![Accuracy Curve](results/accuracy_curve.png)

> These curves are exported from TensorBoard logs (`.tfevents` files) for clarity and reproducibility.

---

## 📁 CSV Data Files

We also export raw scalar values for fine-grained analysis:

- `loss_overall_loss.csv`: Training loss over steps
- `stage1_objectness_acc.csv`: Accuracy in stage 1

---

## 🛠️ How to Regenerate Logs

1. Export from TensorBoard UI (`...` → `Download CSV`)
2. Or use our script:

```bash
pip install tensorboard pandas
python3 export_tensorboard_scalars.py
